# FACTS_placement_w_load_share
FACTS_placement_w_load_share is a tool for studying FACTS placement attending to load share. A STATCOM-type FACTS device is implemented in the power system simulator and load share is changed among 3 demand zones iteratively. 

Power system stability indices are calculated and different charts may be created. 

This tool is implemented using Python 2.7.13 so as to use PSS-E 34 as a simulation platform.
